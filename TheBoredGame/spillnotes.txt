- Add two players
  - Make units belong to either player
- Highlight code clean-up
- Endre BelongsTo til "player" Bare bruke den player class hos boardobject, i stedet for enum.

- Endre slik at highlight drawer seg selv.
- Win-Condition, slik at når en spiller mister alle brikker, så stopper spillet.
